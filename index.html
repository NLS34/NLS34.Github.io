<br>Hi! Welcome to my photo gallery site. The photos are free to look at,
<br>however to download for personal or business use I ask that you donate at least $2 to me at
<br>
<br>Paypal.me/NathanScheinberg
<br>or
<br> https://gofund.me/e64e982d
<br>Venmo: NLS34     CashApp: $NScheinberg
<br>I am not an intentional sinner so please don't steal from me or you will end up paying $4.
<br>To get the best pictures from a site like Pixabay you need to pay a $15 monthly subscription.
		<br>
		<br>Another reason these pictures are worth $2 over pixabay or the like;
		<br>Exodus 20:21:
		<br>In every place that there is remembrance of My Name I will go to you and bless you.
		<br>Most of the pictures are from Ir Yehochanan (Johnstown) meaning G-d is Gracious
		<br>PA which I have renamed PinaShalomYah (The Keystone is Complete Peace, [that is] Y-H)
		<br>Even the old name PennsylvaniYAH has HaShem's name in it
		<br>
<br>Thank you for helping my cause and Lech LeTamim (Walk towards Perfections)
